<h3>3.3. 3.4: Concepts and Frameworks of Business Intelligence </h3>
<p>Section 3.3: Exploring Business Intelligence <br><br>Business intelligence (BI) is a wide-reaching term that implies the assembly and management of large sets of data, often specifically related to the performance of operations and activities within a business. Attempts to collect relevant data within a business or organization necessarily require implementing processes and tools described most simply as “intelligence”. By optimizing and understanding complex relationships, BI enables experts to improve upon business operations in ways difficult or impossible without the use of established algorithms, collections of relevant information, technological infrastructures for storage, and decision support systems for querying and reporting the results. With these adequately in place and properly managed, users can transform data into actionable knowledge and drive valuable insights into both their current operations, immediate needs and long-term strategies. <br><br>At the heart of a successful BI system lies specialized computer-enabled systems geared towards data acquisition and storage of large volumes of rapidly changing data as it arrives from both internal and external sources. Comprehension of this stored data is then possible through ‘Data Mining’ technologies. These complex algorithms extract patterns out of the collected records, uncover hidden meaning and tell stories of events, successes and trends by connecting data to attain meaning. The natural outcome of data mining – deriving knowledge from a mass of seemingly-chaotic input – is then used to support decision-making within an organisation. In addition, cognitive BI systems enable data analytics to supplement existing insight. By quickly displaying patterns to the user in the form of visualisations such as charts, bar graphs and databases, results are much easier to interpret and are additionally stored on communal servers to facilitate comprehensive reference by all staff members at any one time as they need.<br><br>Ultimately, introducing BI in an organization of any size can realise its dedication to effecting dynamic decision-making. It enables both employees and decision makers of any stature to keep ahead of the game by considering both short-term and longer-term data, identifying trends for performance enhancement and concurrently plotting new tasks with informed hindsight. All parts of any business therefore benefit from implementing the combined implementations of information extraction processes, storage structures, and data analysis and organisation protocols as combined contemporary intelligences. BI consequently offers far-reaching constructive changes to both organizational management techniques and analytical navigation of today’s enormous amount of data both through marketing, finance, risk internal controls and more.</p>

For businesses where uptime is most critical, public cloud hosting may be the better choice due to redundant ability and open equity between providers. <br> <br>The scale of the hosting solution will also play a role in what the security requirements are for the ERP system. For some businesses, a cost-effective solution may mean relying on internal services and resources. While managing the system with internal services will involve wrestling with software licensing, storage, maintenance, and IT infrastructure, it also allows for better local control and understanding of any issues. Other systems tend to rely on backup and redundancy, often times with companies utilizing geographically redundant sites, hybrid hosting solutions, or DNS to lower the extent of failure if something should happen at one site. Managing this involve understanding primary hosting warehouses should be larger, with an equal dedicated wireless connection, and understanding of possible impacts. <br><br>Finally, it is important to consider the possibility of the out-paced growth commonly associated with larger businesses. ERP systems should match the size and growth potential of the business, especially when looking for dedicated overall hosting for the solution. This can be a daunting challenge, as configured public cloud servers which store data and application components often times still lack scalability capabilities and ability to reconfigure. This is why some companies also may rely on a combination of solutions allowing organizations to grow while also allowing them to make changes along the way–for instance, utilizing a copy process and data loading environment that can easily expand. <br><br>Besides organizations wanting to focus on Dedicated hosting solutions, it is important to consider encryption solutions, Web vulnerability solutions to look for Inappropriate inputs and tokens, session IDs, malicious cookies, intrusion protection security system windows for servers, additional firewall protection for managing the two closest networks to a system, backup and distributions plans along the applications within the cloud on high quality, server load balancers, quality controlled solutions to remote IT support portals, plus other areas such as selectivity and data throttling when implementing more powerful mobile providers. Therefore, consideration should be give toa well-crafted combination of solutions to go along with scheduling and reliable managed systems to ensure data privacy also meet certain control system standards for compliance.</p>

Hosting often operates on shared system resources, so it’s important to choose the right setup and allocate the right processes and functions to the appropriate webserver. That’s why businesses are turning to experts to help them determine the best hosting solution they need after they finish installing ERP software. <br><br>Depending upon the capabilities of your ERP, you may want to choose dedicated hosting or virtual private hosting. Dedicated hosting is the most reliable, allowing businesses to use a dedicated server in their own setup, ensuring their ERP is better protected. Virtual private hosting companies can also provide additional services, if required, such as firewalls, software patching services and antimalware/antivirus policies. <br><br>When consulting an outside service for help with a hosting solution, there are a few things that must be taken into consideration. Generally speaking, hosting cost will increase with the size (number of users) or complexity (business data) of the system. Additional considerations that may have an effect on the cost can include hosting features such as a control panel for administration, accounting for upgrades and updates, security systems in place for virus protection, availability and scalability options, including load balancing to prevent system outages and server downtime, communication speed or the ability to migrate from one ERP system to another. And last, but not least, customer service responsiveness should also play a large role in choosing the right company.<br><br>Unfortunately, collaboration issue with hosting solutions can also pose problems. Working with external parties can require numerous meetings and meetings during changing times when it’s necessary to update and manage changes to existing programs, processes, protocols and designs can impair your work flow. Implementation services offered to clients through specialized hosting companies should be on top of their hosting process.<br><br>The importance of developing short and consistent change management procedures should be mirrored in recent changes in your software and accession of new personnel and systems. All teams in charge of installing hosting solutions should focus on including cost-effective solutions, networking consistency and scalability. The result will be better collaboration, which leads to a successful hosting outcome and increased specifications for managing access control and process improvements at enterprise levels. <br><br>Hosting for ERP in there simplest of forms is basically hosting a website and a hosted mission control.
